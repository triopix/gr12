My own definition of a power and polynomial function:

A polynomial function is defined to be a function with the form represented on the pdf. It consists of terms that have a coefficient, variable value, and exponent. The terms are written in decreasing order with the leading coefficient (coefficient that has the largest exponent value) and largest degree first. 

for example

ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d

Here, a, b, and c denote the coefficients for each term, and their following exponents. 

"a" - can be any real number
"x" - can take on any real value
and "n" - exponent has to be a whole number (non-negative integer) - no rational values / irrational values

Power function

A power function is a special type of function. A power function is NOT a polynomial functions. Though, they are similar in ways. 

A power function consists of a single term (coefficient, variable value, and an exponent n)

Here is the formal representation:

f(x) = ax^n

Here "a" - can be any real number
Here "x" - can take on any real value

But the biggest differentiation here is that "n" has to be a ***FIXED*** real number. It can be non-negative, it can be fractional, but it cannot be the transcendental numbers such as pi, eulers number or anything else that falls under the transcendental numbers category. 

This is where it's different form a polynomial function.

Types of other functions - not all functions are polynomial functions:
